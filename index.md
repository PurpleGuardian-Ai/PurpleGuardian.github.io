# Project 1. Active Directory Project with Splunk
## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and configuration of a secure Active Directory environment in VirtualBox, leveraging Splunk for log analysis and telemetry. It also showcases penetration testing techniques and log monitoring for cybersecurity purposes.

## Project Objectives
*   Simulate a network environment with Active Directory and Splunk.
*   Deploy a penetration testing scenario using Kali Linux.
*   Enable log monitoring and generate telemetry through Splunk Universal Forwarders.
*   Analyze brute-force attack attempts on user accounts using Splunk.

## Network Diagram
1.  Splunk Server: Collects and visualizes log data from the network.
2.  Active Directory Server: Hosts the AD domain and manages user authentication.
3.  Windows 10 Target Machine: Serves as a client within the AD environment.
4.  Kali Linux Attacker Machine: Used for penetration testing and attack simulation.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
